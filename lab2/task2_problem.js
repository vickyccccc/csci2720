    // Given this array:
    let a = ["red", "pink", "green"]
    // Using .splice(), delete “pink” and add “orange” and “yellow”.

    // How? See: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp
    // Ask the user for one extra color name and store it at the end of the array.
    // How can you sort the array and store results in another variable?
    // Print the array using a for…of loop, using document.write() and <br>
